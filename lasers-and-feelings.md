# Lasers & Feelings

> YOU ARE THE CREW OF THE INTERSTELLAR SCOUT SHIP **RAPTOR**. Your mission is to explore uncharted regions of space, deal with aliens both friendly and deadly, and defend the Consortium worlds against space dangers. **CAPTAIN DARCY** has been overcome by the strange psychic entity known as *Something Else*, leaving you to fend for yourselves while he recovers in a medical pod.

## Players: create characters

1. Choose a style for your character: **Alien, Android, Dangerous, Hot-Shot, Intrepid, Savvy**, or **Sexy**.
2. Choose a role for your character: **Doctor, Envoy, Engineer, Explorer, Pilot, Scientist**, or **Soldier**.
3. Choose your **number**, from 2 to 5. A high number means you’re better at **LASERS** (technology; science; cold rationality; calm, precise action). A low number means you’re better at **FEELINGS** (intuition; diplomacy; seduction; wild, passionate action).
4. Give your character a **cool space adventure name**. Like Sparks McGee or something.

**You have:** a Consortium uniform (with built-in vacc-suit for space walks), a super-sweet space-phone-camera- communicator-scanner thing (with universal translator), a variable-beam phase pistol (set to stun, usually).

**Player goal:** Get your character involved in crazy space adventures and try to make the best of them.

**Character goal:** Choose one or create your own: **Become Captain, Meet Sexy Aliens, Shoot Bad Guys, Find New Worlds, Solve Weird Space Mysteries, Prove Yourself**, or **Keep Being Awesome** (you have nothing to prove).

## Players: create the ship

As a group, pick two strengths for the *Raptor*: **Fast, Nimble, Well-Armed, Powerful Shields, Superior Sensors, Cloaking Device, Fightercraft**.

Also, pick one problem: **Fuel Hog** (always needs energy crystals), **Only One Medical Pod** (and Captain Darcy is in it), **Horrible Circuit Breakers** (in battle, consoles tend to explode on the bridge), **Grim Reputation** (Captain Darcy did some bad stuff in the past).

## Rolling the dice

When you do something risky, roll **1d6** to find out how it goes. Roll **+1d** if you’re **prepared** and **+1d** if you’re an **expert**. (*The GM tells you how many dice to roll, based on your character and the situation.*)
**Roll your dice and compare each die result to your number**.

↓ If you’re using **LASERS** (science, reason), you want to roll **under** your number.

↑ If you’re using **FEELINGS**, (rapport, passion) you want to roll **over** your number.

**0** **If none of your dice succeed**, it goes wrong. The GM says how things are getting worse somehow.

**1** **If one die succeeds**, you barely manage it. The GM inflicts complication, harm or cost.

**2** **If two dice succeed**, you do it well. Good job!

**3** **If three dice succeed**, you get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get.

**!** **If you roll your number exactly**, you have **LASER FEELINGS**. You get a special insight into what's going on. Ask the GM a question and they'll answer you honestly. Somme good questions:

> What are they really feeling? Who’s behind this? How could I get them to _____? What should I be on the lookout for? What’s the best way to _____? What’s really going on here?

You can change your action if you want to, then roll again.

**HELPING**: If you want to help someone else, who’s rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. If you succeed, give them **+1d**.

| 3. Enslave a planet        | 6. Fix everything         |

## GM: run the game

Play to find out how they defeat the threat. Introduce the threat by showing evidence of its recent badness. Before a threat does something to the characters, show signs that it’s about to happen, then ask them what they do. *“Zorgon charges the mega- cannons on his ship. What do you do?” “Daneela pours you a glass of Arcturan whiskey and slips her arm around your waist. What do you do?”*

Call for a roll when the situation is uncertain. Don’t pre-plan outcomes—let the chips fall where they may. Use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill.

Ask questions and build on the answers. *“Have any of you encountered a Void Cultist before? Where? What happened?”*
